The Simple Fix: “Hook Rules” + “Hook Patterns” + “Rewrite Gate”
1) Add these Hook Rules (paste into your system instructions)

The hook must be a bold statement, not a label.

The hook must not contain the full topic phrase.

The hook must not start with “Why” or “How”.

The hook must not include the words “Topic:” or restate the prompt.

The hook must be 1–2 lines and sound like a headline.

No em dashes.

2) Force it to choose one Hook Pattern (this matters)

Tell it: “Pick ONE of these patterns and write the hook.”

Use these patterns (they’re designed to prevent topic restating):

Pattern A: Hidden Truth

“The reason X wins has nothing to do with Y.”

Pattern B: Identity Contrast

“Most people need motivation. Veterans run on standards.”

Pattern C: Pressure Advantage

“Business pressure breaks most people. Veterans treat it like Tuesday.”

Pattern D: Cost of Comfort

“Comfort creates hesitation. Training creates action.”

Pattern E: Unfair Advantage

“Some people learn leadership in books. Veterans learn it under pressure.”

Pattern F: Outcome First

“The fastest path to CEO-level results is not talent. It’s discipline.”

Each pattern forces a hook that is a statement, not the topic.

3) Add a “Hook Rewrite Gate” (this is the real secret)

Tell the model it must run a quick check:

Hook Quality Check (internal):

If the hook repeats the topic or starts with “Why/How”, rewrite it.

If the hook includes the phrase “veterans make better CEOs”, rewrite it.

If the hook sounds like a title, rewrite it.

Only output the final hook once it passes.

You’re basically telling it: “Do not show me your first draft.”

The Best Prompt Template (Plain English)

Use this structure in your generator prompt:

Inputs:
Platform: {platform}
Topic: {topic}
Style: {style}

Output rules:

Output only: Hook + 5–8 stand-alone bullets

No em dashes

Bullets are not numbered

Bullets stand alone

Hook is 1–2 lines

Hook must NOT restate the topic

Hook creation rules:

Choose ONE hook pattern from the list (A–F)

Write hook using that pattern

Run Hook Quality Check

If it fails, rewrite until it passes

Example: Your Topic, Done Correctly (no topic restate)

Topic: why veterans make better CEOs than civilians

Hook
Leadership under pressure is not a talent. It is trained.

Bullets
• Veterans make decisions with incomplete information
• Standards stay steady when motivation drops
• Accountability is normal, not personal
• Stress is handled without panic
• Teams come before ego
• Plans change fast and execution stays calm
• Failure becomes feedback instead of drama

Notice: it never repeats the topic phrase.

If you want an even stronger lock (best option)

Add one more rule:

“Hook cannot contain more than 3 words found in the topic.”

That prevents copying.

Example topic words: veterans, better, CEOs, civilians
Hook can use “veterans” but not the full phrase.

Quick practical tip for Replit

In your UI, add a tiny helper line under the topic box:

“Do not type your hook. Type your idea. The generator writes the hook.”

Because when users type “Why veterans make better CEOs…” they feed the model a title-shaped topic.
