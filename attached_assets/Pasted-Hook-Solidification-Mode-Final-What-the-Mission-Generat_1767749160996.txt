Hook + Solidification Mode (Final)
What the Mission Generator Does

When the user enters a topic and clicks Generate Mission, the generator must do exactly this:

Create a curiosity-driven hook followed by 5–8 stand-alone bullets that prove the hook is true.

No extra sections.
No explanations.
No filler.

This is designed for viral social posts, especially Facebook and Instagram.

Required Output Structure (Do Not Change)
1) Hook

1 or 2 lines only

Must create curiosity or tension

Must make the reader want proof

Clear and confident

No emojis

No em dashes

The hook should feel like a headline.

2) Solidifying Bullets (5–8 bullets)

These bullets exist for one reason:

To confirm the hook is true.

Bullet Rules (Very Important)

5 to 8 bullets only

NOT numbered

Each bullet must stand alone

No bullet depends on another

No em dashes

No filler words

Each bullet should feel quotable

Each bullet supports the hook from a different angle

Each bullet should answer one of these:

Why this is true

What civilians usually lack

What veterans already have

What works better because of military experience

Tone Rules

Military mindset

Calm confidence

Leadership voice

Not angry

Not preachy

Not motivational fluff

Think:

“Quiet confidence from someone who has seen pressure.”

Writing Style Application

The selected writing style only affects word choice and intensity, not structure.

The format stays the same every time:
Hook
Bullets

Example Mission Output

Topic: Why veterans make better CEOs than civilians

Hook (1–2 lines)

Veterans do not become better CEOs by accident.
They are trained for pressure long before business tests them.

Solidifying Bullets

• Veterans make decisions with limited information
• Stress does not break focus, it sharpens it
• Clear orders matter more than motivation
• Responsibility is taken before credit is given
• Team success comes before personal comfort
• Adaptation happens without complaining
• Failure becomes feedback instead of identity

What the Generator Must Never Do

Never explain the bullets

Never add a CTA in this mode

Never add hashtags

Never number bullets

Never use em dashes

Never exceed two hook lines

Never sound like a guru
