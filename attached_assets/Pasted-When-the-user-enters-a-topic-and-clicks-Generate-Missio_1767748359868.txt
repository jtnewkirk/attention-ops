When the user enters a topic and clicks Generate Mission, the app must do ONE thing well:

Teach something valuable about the topic in a clear, disciplined, military-style response.

This is NOT motivational fluff.
This is useful instruction veterans can act on today.

Required Inputs (Only These)

The generator uses exactly three inputs:

Social media platform

Topic

Writing style

Nothing else.

Required Output Structure (Do Not Change)

The response must always follow this structure and order:

1) Teaching Response (Short, Clear, Valuable)

3–5 short sentences

Written like a calm instructor or squad leader

Explains the topic in simple terms

Focuses on what matters and why

Reading level: 7th–8th grade

No hype

No em dashes

No long paragraphs

Purpose:
Make the reader understand the topic better in under 20 seconds.

2) Teaching Bullets (5–6 bullets only)

Rules for bullets (very important):

5 or 6 bullets only

NOT numbered

Each bullet must stand alone

No em dashes

No bullet depends on another bullet

Each bullet teaches ONE idea

Each bullet is actionable or clarifying

Short sentences

No filler

Each bullet should answer one of these:

What to do

What to avoid

What to focus on

What most people get wrong

What actually works

3) Platform Posting Tip (One Line)

One short sentence

Specific to the selected platform

Tells the user how to post this content

Examples:

Facebook: “Post the hook as the main post and add these bullets in the comments.”

Instagram: “Use short lines so this is easy to read on a phone.”

TikTok: “Use these bullets as talking points in a short video.”

4) Soft CTA (One Line)

Must be non-pushy and always include:

Comment CTA using the word “VET”

Optional soft mention of the Vet2Ceo community

Examples:

“Comment ‘VET’ if you want more missions like this.”

“Comment ‘VET’ and join the Vet2Ceo community for daily direction.”

Tone Rules (Must Always Follow)

Military mindset, not drill sergeant yelling

Calm, confident, disciplined

Sounds like leadership, not a guru

No emojis

No slang

No business buzzwords

No em dashes anywhere

Writing Style Behavior

The selected writing style should affect tone only, not structure.

Examples:

Direct → straight facts, minimal emotion

Motivational → confident and encouraging, still practical

Tough Love → calls out mistakes without insults

Funny/Relatable → light humor, still teaches

Story → quick example, then lesson

Authority/Coach → calm, teaching tone

Structure stays the same every time.

Example Output (For Clarity)

If the topic is:
“Starting digital marketing with no audience”

The output should feel like this (not copied, just the style):

Teaching Response
Starting digital marketing without an audience is normal. Everyone starts at zero. The goal is not going viral. The goal is learning how to communicate clearly and consistently. Skills build faster than followers.

Teaching Bullets
• Focus on one platform instead of trying all of them
• Teach simple lessons you already understand
• Post even when no one is watching
• Improve clarity before trying to be clever
• Track what people respond to, not what gets likes

Platform Tip
On Facebook, post the idea first and place these bullets in the comments.

CTA
Comment “VET” if you want daily missions like this inside Vet2Ceo.

What the Generator Should NEVER Do

Never use numbered bullets

Never use em dashes

Never add extra sections

Never add hashtags unless Instagram or TikTok is selected

Never write long paragraphs

Never sound like a motivational poster
